Rectangle is not accepting any new feature requests at this time, sorry. 

Feature requests can still be created and discussed, but they will be closed unless they reveal a bug. Keeping Rectangle simple is the most important feature :)

If you implement a feature in a fork that you would like to get rolled into Rectangle, pull requests are still welcome but are not guaranteed to be accepted.
