# Rectangle

Rectangle is a window management app based on Spectacle, written in Swift.

## System Requirements
Rectangle arbitrarily supports macOS v10.12+. If you're willing to test on earlier versions of macOS, this can be updated.

##  Keyboard Shortcuts
The default keyboard shortcuts are based on Spectacle, but there is an alternative set of defaults based on the Magnet app. This can be enabled by setting "alternateDefaultShortcuts" to true in NSUserDefaults for Rectangle.

##  Differences with Spectacle
Spectacle used it's own keyboard shortcut recorder, while Rectangle uses MASShortcut.

There are still a number of Spectacle features that are not implemented in Rectangle, such as next/previous thirds. Feel free to send a pull request for anything missing.
